        <h2>The Issue</h2>
        <p>Clean, drinkable water is a necessity for all human beings. But in some areas, water can be unclean, too far away, or even rare. Many people in third-world countries have very little drinkable water. Some have to walk miles to get their water, and even then, it's usually not safe to drink.</p>
        
        <h2>What Can We Do to Help?</h2>
        <p>We all can pitch in to help people in these dry areas by supporting oranizations such as Water is Life Kenya, Charity: Water, and Three Avocados. If we all do our part, people in developing countries can have clean, running water. </p>
